## What is a cross-chain
A cross-chain is the interoperability between two relatively independent blockchains.
In other words, it allows blockchains to speak to one another because they’re
built in a standardized way. 

Cross-chain implementation is mainly represented by asset swap and asset transfer,
which is both an important part of the blockchain world and a key research direction of PPIO.
With cross-chains, the limitations of a single chain can be avoided.

## Existing Cross chains
The following are a list of known cross chains that we might use 
to deploy our token in multiple blockchains.

Anyone can cross-chain their token contracts through ChainSwap’s permissionless bridge system. This feature is suitable for three cases:

* You already have a token issued on one chain such as Ethereum, and you have not issued your tokens on other chains.
* You already have a token issued on one chain such as Ethereum, and you have not issued your tokens on other chains. You want your token contract address to be the same on all chains. (Coming Soon)
* You have not issued your tokens and you are looking to issue a new token. (Coming Soon)

Early solutions such as “atomic swaps” solve part of this problem using time-bound smart contracts called HTLCs (Hash Timelock Contracts). But there are several problems with atomic swap exchanges (Google “double-spend attacks” and “Uniswap” if you want to dig a little deeper).
